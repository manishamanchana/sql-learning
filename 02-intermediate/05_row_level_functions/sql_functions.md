# SQL Functions

SQL Functions are built-in operations that take input values, process them, and return an output. They enhance querying capabilities by allowing calculations, transformations, and conditional logic within queries.

SQL functions fall into two main types:

### 1. Single-Row Functions

- Return **one result per input row**.
- Types:
  - String Functions
  - Date & Time Functions
  - Numeric Functions
  - Null Functions

### 2. Multi-Row Functions
- Operate on **multiple rows**.
- Return **one aggregated result**.
- Types:
  - Aggregate Functions (Basic)
  - Window Functions (Advanced)

## Nested Functions

Functions can also be **nested** â€” i.e., using one function inside another for compound operations.
